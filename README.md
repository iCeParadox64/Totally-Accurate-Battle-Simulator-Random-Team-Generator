# Totally Accurate Battle Simulator - Random Team Generator
Generates a random team for Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (TABS).

- User inputs the budget for the team, and the generator tries to get as close to it as possible.

- Only selects from the [default units](https://totally-accurate-battle-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Units#List_of_Units), no secret/unlockable units.

- Has a 1 in 100 chance of your team being all halflings :)

Made as a Python practice project, directly inspired by a script used in [this DougDoug stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9QzFRJqHzA). I don't believe said script was ever made public, so I made my own.
